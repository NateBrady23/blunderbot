# Command Overrides

You can use this directory to add your own private commands or copy/paste/edit existing BlunderBot commands. These commands aren't tracked in git. Anything placed in here with the same name as an existing command in the `src/commands` directory will override the existing command.

### NOTE

If you're making an improvement to an existing command, please don't hesitate to submit a pull request for that improvement. I'd love to see what you come up with!
